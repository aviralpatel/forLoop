# For Loops in C

A for loop in C is a control flow statement that allows you to repeat a block of code a fixed number of times. A for loop is typically used when you know the number of times you want to execute a block of code.

The three parts of a for loop are:

Initialization: The codethat is executed before the loop starts. This is where you initialize any variables that will be used in the loop.
Condition: The code that is executed before each iteration of the loop. If the condition is true, the loop continues. If the condition is false, the loop ends.
Increment/Decrement: The code that is executed after each iteration of the loop. This is where you update any variables that are used in the loop.

```
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
}
```
